                  <p>Owethu Managed Services (OMS) is a 100% black female owned organization which is 
                  based in Gauteng, South Africa.</p><p> Our core value proposition is IT Resource augmentation as 
                  a managed service. We specialize in IT system development projects as we are experts in 
                  project management, Business Process Engineering and design, Business Analysis, 
                  Development and Testing Engineering.
                  We assist organizations reach their strategic goals by partnering with them in their IT 
                  initiative. We implement projects using two approaches which are:<br>
                  <br>
                  <span style="color: #e1c44a">i. Resource Augmentation, where we provide the client with required resources and 
                  the client manages the project end to end.
                  Within this model we offer time and material Resources-on-demand to ensure that 
                  the client does not have to bear FTE costs after the project is closed.
                 <br> ii. The second method is a milestone based approach where we take full responsibility 
                  for a project, or a project phase, or an aspect of a project phase.
                  Our team operates using both AGILE and Waterfall frameworks depending on the 
                  clients preferences.</span></p>
